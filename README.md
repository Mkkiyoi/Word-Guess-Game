### How does the game work?

* This word guessing game allows the player to guess a word by pressing the letter keys on the keyboard to guess letters in that word. 

* Each letter that has not been guessed is represented by a **-**. 

* Each game the player gets 12 guesses or can guess 12 letters in the word before the game is over. 

* If the player completely guesses the word before running out of guesses, the player wins! 

* At the end of each game, an image representative of the word will show on the left side of the game. The gae will also reset and a new word will be chosen.
